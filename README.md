A web application that helps users track and analyze Costco deals and savings.

## Project Structure

- `frontend/`: SvelteKit-based web interface
- `backend/`: Cloudflare Worker with D1 database
- `crawler/`: Python-based data collection system

## Key Features

- **Deal Search**: Search through all historical deals by keyword.
- **Advanced Timeline Visualization**: View a product's entire deal history in a year-by-year, month-by-month timeline. Partial month coverage is shown with triangle highlights, and full months are fully highlighted.
- **Interactive Tooltips**: Hover over any highlighted month to see detailed deal info, including discount, valid period, limit, and channel, with visually distinct highlights.
- **Image Toggling**: Enable or disable product image loading to save bandwidth.
- **Daily Deals**: View all active deals for the current day.
- **Accurate Local Date Handling**: All deal periods are displayed using local time, ensuring correct month alignment regardless of timezone.

## Technical Stack

- Frontend: SvelteKit + TypeScript
- Backend: Cloudflare Workers + D1
- Testing: Vitest (for TypeScript/JavaScript) + Playwright (for E2E)
- Data Pipeline: Python + Playwright
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or later)
- Python 3.8+
- Cloudflare Workers CLI (wrangler)
- Git

### Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   git clone <repository-url>
   cd costco-deals-finder
   ```

2. Install root dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your Cloudflare credentials
   ```

4. Install and set up each component:

   **Frontend:**

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

   - Features a responsive, interactive timeline for historical deals (see below).

   wrangler d1 execute costco-dev --file=./migrations/0000_init.sql
   ```

   **Crawler:**

   ```bash
   cd crawler
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .\venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. Start development servers:

   ```bash
   # Frontend (in one terminal)
   cd frontend
   npm run dev

   # Backend (in another terminal)
   cd backend
   npm run dev
   ```

## Environment Variables & Secrets

- **Root `.env`**: Contains shared configuration and Cloudflare credentials
- **Frontend**: Uses environment variables from root `.env` prefixed with `PUBLIC_`
- **Backend**: Uses `wrangler.toml`/`wrangler.dev.toml` for config, and `wrangler secret` for secrets
- **CI/CD**: Store secrets in GitHub Actions Secrets

## Frontend Timeline UI (New)

- The search page now groups deals by product and displays a timeline for each product.
- Each timeline row represents a year, with 12 boxes for each month.
- If a deal covers a month, the box is highlighted (fully or as a triangle for partial coverage).
- Hovering a highlighted month shows a tooltip with all deal details (discount, period, limit, channel, etc.).
- All date calculations use local time for accuracy.
